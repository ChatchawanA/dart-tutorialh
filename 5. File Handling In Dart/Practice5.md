--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
## 1.Write a dart program to add your name to “hello.txt” file.
 ```dart
  import 'dart:io'; 

void main() {
  final file = File('hello.txt');
  file.writeAsStringSync('your name');
}
   ```
### • C
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
  
int main()
{
    // file pointer
    FILE* fptr;
  
    // creating file using fopen() access mode "w"
    fptr = fopen("hello.txt", "w");
  
    // checking if the file is created
    if (fptr == NULL) {
        printf("The file is not opened. The program will "
               "exit now");
        exit(0);
    }
    else {
        printf("The file is created Successfully : your name");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
### • Java
```java
import java.io.File;
 
// Displaying file property
class fileProperty {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
 
        // accept file name or directory name through
        // command line args
        String fname = args[0];
 
        // pass the filename or directory name to File
        // object
        File f = new File(fname);
 
        // apply File class methods on File object
        System.out.println("File name :" + f.getName());
 
        if (f.exists()) {
            System.out.println("Is writable:"
                               + f.canWrite());
            System.out.println("Is readable:" + f.canRead());
            System.out.println("Is a directory:"
                               + f.isDirectory());
            System.out.println("File Size in bytes "
                               + f.length());
        }
    }
}
```
### • Python
```python
  # Python code to illustrate with() alongwith write()
with open("hello.txt", 'w') as f:
	f.write("your name")

```

## 2.Write a dart program to append your friends name to a file that already has your name.
```dart
 import 'dart:io'; 

void main() {
  final file = File('hello.txt');
  file.writeAsStringSync('your name');
  file.writeAsStringSync('\nyour friends name', mode: FileMode.append);
   ```
### • C
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // File path
    const char *filePath = "names.txt";

    // Your name
    const char *yourName = "Your Name";

    // Your friend's name
    const char *friendName = "Friend's Name";

    // Open the file in append mode
    FILE *file = fopen(filePath, "a");
    
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    // Append your friend's name
    fprintf(file, "%s\n", friendName);

    // Close the file
    fclose(file);

    printf("Friend's name added to the file.\n");

    return 0;
}
```
### • Java
```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class AppendToFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // File path
        String filePath = "names.txt";

        // Your name
        String yourName = "Your Name";

        // Your friend's name
        String friendName = "Friend's Name";

        try {
            // Open the file in append mode
            BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath, true));

            // Append your friend's name
            writer.write(friendName);
            writer.newLine();

            // Close the writer
            writer.close();

            System.out.println("Friend's name added to the file.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## 3.Write a dart program to get the current working directory.
-Make sure you have the path package added to your pubspec.yaml file
```dart
  dependencies:
  path: ^1.8.0
   ```
-Import the necessary libraries and create the Dart program
```dart
  import 'dart:io';
import 'package:path/path.dart';

void main() {
  String currentDirectory = Directory.current.path;
  print('Current working directory: $currentDirectory');
}
   ```
<details>
<summary><strong>Output</strong></summary>
<pre>
<code>Current working directory: /path/to/your/current/directory.</code>
</pre>
</details>

### • C
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main() {
    char cwd[PATH_MAX];

    if (getcwd(cwd, sizeof(cwd)) != NULL) {
        printf("Current working directory: %s\n", cwd);
    } else {
        perror("getcwd() error");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
### • Java
```java
public class GetCurrentWorkingDirectory {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String currentDirectory = System.getProperty("user.dir");
        System.out.println("Current working directory: " + currentDirectory);
    }
}
```
### • Python
```python
import os

current_directory = os.getcwd()
print("Current working directory:", current_directory)
```

## 4.Write a dart program to copy the “hello.txt” file to “hello_copy.txt” file.
```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  copyFile("hello.txt", "hello_copy.txt");
}

void copyFile(String sourcePath, String destinationPath) {
  File sourceFile = File(sourcePath);
  File destinationFile = File(destinationPath);

  if (!sourceFile.existsSync()) {
    print("Source file not found.");
    return;
  }

  try {
    sourceFile.copySync(destinationPath);
    print("File copied successfully.");
  } catch (e) {
    print("An error occurred: $e");
  }
}
   ```
<details>
<summary><strong>Output</strong></summary>
<pre>
<code>File copied successfully.</code>
</pre>
</details>

### • C
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

    FILE *source_file, *destination_file;
    char ch;

    source_file = fopen("hello.txt", "r");
    if (source_file == NULL) {
        printf("Source file not found.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    destination_file = fopen("hello_copy.txt", "w");
    if (destination_file == NULL) {
        printf("Error creating destination file.\n");
        fclose(source_file);
        return 1;
    }

    while ((ch = fgetc(source_file)) != EOF) {
        fputc(ch, destination_file);
    }

    printf("File copied successfully.\n");

    fclose(source_file);
    fclose(destination_file);

    return 0;
}
```
### • Python
```python
def copy_file(source_path, destination_path):
    try:
        with open(source_path, 'r') as source_file:
            with open(destination_path, 'w') as destination_file:
                destination_file.write(source_file.read())
        print("File copied successfully.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Source file not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

def main():
    source_file_path = "hello.txt"
    destination_file_path = "hello_copy.txt"
    copy_file(source_file_path, destination_file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

## 5.Write a dart program to create 100 files using loop.

import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    createFile('file_$i.txt', 'This is the content of file $i.');
  }
}

void createFile(String filename, String content) {
  File file = File(filename);

  try {
    file.writeAsStringSync(content);
    print('File $filename created successfully.');
  } catch (e) {
    print('An error occurred: $e');
  }
